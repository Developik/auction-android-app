The below coding standards should be followed for all projects files.

1. Variable names: Use Camel Case (thisIsAnExample)
2. Constant names: Use all upercase with words separated with _ text (THIS_IS_AN_EXAMPLE)
3. Class names: Uppercase first letter of word (ThisIsClassExample)
4. Bracket placement: Follow the template below
    foo(int param) {
      // contents
    }
5. Indentation: Use Android Studio default of 4 spaces (can hit tab to get 4 spaces)
6. Comments: Add comments when it is not clear what the code is doing.
             Use good variable names and functions (clean code) to limit need for excess commenting.
7. Instance variables: Should not be public. Use getters and setters when required.
8. Only include imports that are used.
